Version 3.3.1 (for VaultIC 4xx)
-> improve compabibility with raspberry pi4
-> fix regression in SPI introduced in 3.3.0 (random comm errors)
-> fix reset control issue (STM32 only)

Version 3.3.0 (for VaultIC 4xx)
-> fix issue when using AES keywrapping with SCP03
-> remove clock stretch disabling on raspberry (no more required with new i2c-bcm2835 driver)
-> fix block protocol startup issue in case of comm errors
-> fix issue on raspberry pi 4 (I2C speed was not changed)
-> upgrade windows projects to VS2022
-> add support of legacy mode in Set Config of Vic408
-> rename VLT_SET_CFG_AARDVARK_TIMEOUT to VLT_SET_CFG_USE_SHORT_TWI_TIMEOUT
-> fix issue when using KeyWrapping in P25 without padding
-> improve Generate Assurance Message (compare signer id internally instead of returning it and rely on host to do it)
-> fix some structures and enumerations missing VLT_ prefix
-> fix some functions missing const for pointer parameters
-> optimize spi settings (reduce internal delays)
-> add missing I2C start byte when using wiseboard
-> check rsa component lengths are multiple of 4
-> remove deprecated features
-> review gpio management on raspberry (use gpio ABI on Linux instead of deprecated sysfs)
-> remove I2C driver reset on raspberry (requires modified board for a proprer VCC off)
-> add new method VltControlUninit() to unconfigure GPIOs used for power and reset control
-> add new VltTimerxx() methods, used for managing comm timeouts properly
-> use BLK_PTCL_CHECKSUM_SUM8 by default
-> optimize start time
-> reduce power off delay from 500 to 100ms
-> reduce polling time from 100 to 10ms (i2c raspberry)
-> reactivate VLT_ALG_KDF_HASH_MODE
-> improve AES key wrapping demo with more key types
-> add new VaultIC408 specific features
    -> reduced start up delay
    -> SetFipsAlgo
    -> SetFipsLevel
    -> SecurePassword
    -> GenerateSymmetricKey
    -> KTS AES (remove CRC)
    -> KTS AES P25
    -> KTS AES NIST SP800
    -> Extended Get Info
-> cleanup
    -> disable DSA by default
    -> remove old code related to MQTT and BLE
    -> remove display lib information

Version 3.2.2  (for VaultIC 4xx)
-> fix init errors on raspberry when using I2C

Version 3.2.1  (for VaultIC 4xx)
-> add support of raspberry and esp32 
-> add new definition entries in VaultIC_product.h to reduce code size when some features are not used
-> fix error when calling VltApiClose several times
-> remove warning when host crypto not used
-> fix key derivation issue (ARM only)
-> improve code robustness (parameters check)
-> fix issue when using keywrapping to read RSA keys 
-> fix issue when using vltDeriveKey with KDF X963
-> fix issue when using vltPutKey with DSA private keys
